Week3 Lab Program:
 
Questions:
Write a C# Program to read a number ‘n’ from the user and generate the first ‘n’ numbers of a Fibonacci series:
Example:
Enter the number of terms to display: 10
The Fibonacci series is: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

 Hint:
 By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are either 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, 
 depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

The sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation:

Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
Let, F1 = 0 and F2 = 1

Hence, F3 = F2 + F1, F3 = 0 + 1 =1
